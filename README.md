Stocks Analysis

Using VBA we take a look into a large list of stocks and their various performance metrics from 2014-2016.

Once the macro is run using the provided button, it will color code each stock's yearly change to show green for a positive change or red for a negative change, and provide data for which ticker had the greatest % increase, greasted % decrease, and greatest total volume for the year. After the process is complete, the user will have the option to continue the process on the next sheet, or end the macro.
